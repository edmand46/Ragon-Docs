Motivation

When I researched the market for available game networking solutions for unity are limited to the following options

Paid closed-loop solutions:
* Proven
* Supported
* Expensive
* Vendorlock

High level open-source free solutions:
* Free
* Community
* Support
* A lot of headaches with deploying infrastructure in order to release the game
* High infrastructure costs

Low tier open-source free solutions
* Free
* Community
* Support
* A lot of headaches with rolling out the infrastructure to release the game
* Higher demands on developer skills, more effort and money

So I wanted a solution that would allow me to develop games quickly and easily, and scale without spending more money and time.

So this solution - Ragon it's very simple network engine free and opensource, what will be enough for most games, with posibility to extend server logic for what do you want
