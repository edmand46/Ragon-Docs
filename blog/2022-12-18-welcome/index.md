Motivation
When I researched the market for available game networking solutions for unity are limited to the following options

Paid closed-loop solutions:
* Proven
* Supported
* Expensive
* Vendor lock

High-level open-source free solutions:
* Free
* Community
* Support
* A lot of headaches with deploying infrastructure to release the game
* High infrastructure costs

I wanted a solution that would allow me to develop games quickly and easily, and scale without spending more money and time.
So this solution - Ragon it's a network engine free and open source, which will be enough for most games, with the possibility to extend server logic for what you want network solution for unity
