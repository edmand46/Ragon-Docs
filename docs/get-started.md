# Get started

Ragon consists of two components that we will need to get started, they are Simple Server and Unity SDK.

- Simple Server is a built-in binary server with no additional extensions, the easiest way to get started with Ragon

- Unity SDK is an SDK containing api for working with the server, at the moment there is a high-level api (still in development) and a low-level one that will allow you to build a more optimal solution for your game

### Ragon Simple Server
Simple server can be downloaded from releases from github:
- [Download](https://github.com/edmand46/Ragon/releases)


### Ragon Unity SDK
 For installing Ragon Unity SDK, we will use Unity Package Manager

Open Unity Package Manager, press "+", press on "Add package from git URL"
